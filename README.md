Covid-19 Data Analysis Project using Python


# Covid-19 Data Analysis Project

## 📊 Overview

This project analyzes Covid-19 data for South Africa using Python.
The analysis focuses on confirmed cases, deaths, and overall trends of the virus over time.

## 🧰 Tools & Libraries

* Pandas → data collection and cleaning
* NumPy → basic numerical analysis
* Matplotlib → data visualization

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset used is from *Our World in Data*, which contains real-world Covid-19 statistics such as:

* Total cases
* New cases
* Total deaths

## 🔍 Project Objectives

* To analyze Covid-19 data using Python
* To identify trends and patterns in the spread of the virus
* To explore relationships (correlations) between variables such as cases and deaths
* To visualize the data using graphs

## 📈 Key Analysis

* Trend of total Covid-19 cases over time
* Daily new cases (to observe peaks and waves)
* Total deaths over time
* Correlation between new cases and deaths

## 📊 Results & Insights

* Covid-19 cases increased in waves over time
* Peaks in new cases indicate periods of rapid spread
* Death trends generally follow case trends
* A positive correlation exists between new cases and deaths

## ⚠️ Limitations

* Recovery data was not available in the dataset
* Vaccination and lockdown data were limited in this analysis

## ✅ Conclusion

This project demonstrates how Python can be used to analyze real-world data.
It provides insights into Covid-19 trends and helps understand how the virus spread over time.
